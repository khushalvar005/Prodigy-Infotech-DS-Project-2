Here is the submission for Task 2 of Data Science internship project at Prodigy Infotech. In this task ,I have perfomed Data cleaning and Exploratry Data Analysis(EDA) on a dataset which i picked form https://www.kaggle.com/, focusing on pattern and trends in Dataset

# Dataset
I picked [test.csv](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/20942112/test.csv) from kaggle for this task. This Dataset contains information about 418 passengers

# Tools and Libraries Used
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas
- Seaaborn
- Matplotlib

# EDA

During the EDA process, I performed the folowing steps:

Data Cleaning: Checked for missing values, duplicates, and outliers in the dataset and handled them accordingly.
Visualization:Created a bar chart, stacked chart to visualize focus on Patterns and Trends


# Conclusion
It prepares the data by handling missing values and generates basic visualizations for understanding passenger demographics and fare distributions. It sets a solid foundation for building machine learning models later.
